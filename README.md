# _Dendrodoris sinusensis_, the deep-sea Dendrodoris from the Gulf

This repository host the raw files for the replication of the manuscript "Insights into the phylogeny and evolution of the genus _Dendrodoris_ (Mollusca:
Nudibranchia) with the description of a new deep-sea species"

It is structured in tree main folders:

## Alignments

Here you will find the alignments for the cox1, 16S, and H3 in fasta format.


## Phylogenetic_trees

Here you will find the phylogenetic trees for the concatenated, cox1, 16S, and H3 datasets. MrBayes and IQTREE trees are separated in independent folders.


## Species_delimit
Here you will find the species delimitation results for the best ASAP and PTP models.  MrBayes and IQTREE analyses are separated in independent folders.
